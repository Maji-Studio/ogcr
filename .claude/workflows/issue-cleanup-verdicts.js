You are auditing GitHub issues for Maji-Studio/ogcr against the CURRENT code in the working directory. The issues may be stale: written months ago, possibly already implemented, superseded, duplicated, too big, or under-specified.

Your cluster "${c.key}": issues ${c.issues.map((n) => '#' + n).join(', ')}.

1. Get the full issue data (bodies + comments + closing-PR refs):
   ${extractCmd(c.issues)}
2. Get dedup/shipped context (recently closed issues + last 100 merged PRs):
   ${contextCmd}
3. Read CLAUDE.md and PLAN.md. For design-system issues, also read packages/design-system/docs/design-system.md and relevant docs/adr/. For farmer issues, read the relevant apps/farmer-prototype/docs files.
4. For EVERY issue, verify its claims against actual code and tests under packages/design-system/ and apps/farmer-prototype/ — never trust the issue body's description of the code. Then assign exactly one verdict:
   - close-implemented: the requested behavior already exists. Evidence MUST cite file:line and, when findable, the PR/commit that shipped it.
   - close-obsolete: superseded by an ADR, redesign, or newer issue. Evidence MUST cite the superseding ref.
   - merge: duplicate/overlapping with another OPEN issue. Set mergeInto to the OLDEST issue of the duplicate group (the oldest gets verdict keep/enhance/split, not merge).
   - split: too big to pick up in one PR. Fill proposedSlices with thin vertical slices (each demoable end-to-end).
   - enhance: keep, but the body is stale vs. current code. Fill staleNotes.
   - grill: keep, but under-specified for implementation. Fill openQuestions.
   - stakeholder-question: the issue primarily needs an answer from OGCR stakeholders, Maji product, or the upstream design-system owner before work can proceed. Fill stakeholderQuestion with a decision-ready question, audience, and what it blocks.
   - keep: already clear and correct.

DECISION GUARDRAIL (hard rules):
- For issues labeled question, dependent on external policy, or crossing the upstream design-system seam, set complianceSensitive=true and locate authoritative product/spec/ADR evidence before judging.
- Such an issue is never close-obsolete on code evidence alone. If stakeholder intent is unresolved, use stakeholder-question rather than close.
- When proposing merge/split, preserve acceptance criteria tied to external decisions or upstream contracts verbatim in your notes.

Also fill stakeholderQuestion (in addition to the verdict) on any grill/keep/enhance issue whose open questions can only be answered by external stakeholders, not by reading code.

Be conservative: when torn between a destructive verdict (close/merge) and keep, prefer keep — a separate adversarial pass will also try to refute your destructive verdicts, so only make them when the evidence is concrete. Return one verdict object per issue, all ${c.issues.length} of them.`

const refutePrompt = (v, clusterKey) => `
Adversarially verify a proposed backlog action for Maji-Studio/ogcr (cluster "${clusterKey}"). Proposed: issue #${v.number} gets verdict "${v.verdict}"${v.mergeInto ? ` (merge into #${v.mergeInto})` : ''}.
Claimed evidence: ${v.evidence}

Try to REFUTE this. Steps:
1. Pull the full issue: ${extractCmd([v.number, ...(v.mergeInto ? [v.mergeInto] : [])])}
2. Check the claimed evidence against the actual code (Read/Grep). For close-implemented: does the code REALLY cover every part of the issue, including edge cases and acceptance criteria? For close-obsolete: does the superseding ref actually make this issue moot, or only part of it? For merge: are the two issues truly the same work, or do they only overlap?
3. ${v.complianceSensitive ? 'This issue depends on an external or unresolved decision: verify that the evidence includes an authoritative spec, ADR, or stakeholder decision, not just code. Code-only evidence for close-obsolete = automatic refute.' : 'Check whether the issue depends on a product, policy, or upstream decision the verdict missed.'}

Default to refuted=true if uncertain — a wrongly-closed issue is worse than a kept one. If refuted, set fallbackVerdict (usually keep, or enhance when the body is merely stale).`
