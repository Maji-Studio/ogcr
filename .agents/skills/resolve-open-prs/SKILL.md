Work the repo's **merge queue** to empty. The main thread is a **conductor**: it surveys, orders, and gates — per-PR legwork (diff comparison, comment fixes, reviews) goes to subagents and the `pr-review-panel` workflow, and only their compact returns enter the main window. Codex mechanics live in the **codex-implementation** and **codex-review** skills (`.claude/skills/codex-*/SKILL.md`) — point subagents there instead of restating commands.

**Guardrails.** `pnpm` only. Never commit directly to `main`. Draft PRs are flagged, not processed, unless the user named them. Every review finding is verified against the actual code before acting — false positives (including bogus P0s) are common. Never trust exit 0 from a piped command. Codex and CodeRabbit are best-effort — degrade gracefully if absent.

## Phase 1 — Survey & queue

Gather the full picture, then bucket every open PR exactly once:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,isDraft,mergeable,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,createdAt,additions,deletions
gh pr view <n> --json body,comments,reviews,statusCheckRollup   # per PR
# unresolved review threads:
gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"<o>",name:"<r>"){pullRequest(number:<n>){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{isResolved path line comments(first:20){nodes{author{login} body}}}}}}}'
```

- **Dedupe first.** PRs that address the same issue or overlap heavily in diff are duplicates: spawn one subagent to compare them and recommend a **winner** (completeness, test coverage, greenness, code quality). Port any clearly superior pieces from the loser into the winner, then close the loser with a comment naming the winner and why. Never process both.
- **Queue order:** (1) dependency order — a PR based on another PR's head branch goes after its base; (2) closest-to-merge first (green CI, fewest unresolved threads); (3) oldest first as tiebreak.

Post the queue — one line per PR with its planned action (merge / close-duplicate / flagged: reason) — before starting Phase 2.

Completion: every open PR is in exactly one bucket — queued, flagged (draft / promotion / blocked), or close-as-duplicate.

## Phase 2 — Per-PR cycle

Run the full cycle for each queued PR in order. After every merge, `main` has moved — the next PR's cycle starts again at Sync.

1. **Sync** — `gh pr checkout <n>`; if behind, merge `origin/main` into the branch and resolve conflicts; push. Confirm `git branch --show-current` is the PR branch before any commit.
2. **Resolve comments** — one resolver subagent handles every unresolved thread and PR-level comment: verify against the code first; fix valid findings with the **minimal** change (one commit per addressed comment — mechanical fixes may go through the codex-implementation skill); decline false positives and gold-plating with a one-line written reason; reply to each thread and resolve it; push.
3. **Panel** — run the `pr-review-panel` workflow (`.claude/workflows/pr-review-panel.js`) with `args: {pr, base, head}`. It runs a gpt-5.6-sol (codex) reviewer and a fresh Claude reviewer in parallel, then a single adversarial verifier that dedupes and confirms — only **confirmed** findings come back. Fix them (codex-implementation for mechanical work), commit, push. If the fixes were substantial, re-run the panel once; **max two rounds** — remaining low-severity nits after round two are judgment calls recorded in the report, not new rounds.
4. **Gate** — `pnpm lint` + focused tests, and `pnpm build` when warranted (read real output, not piped exit codes); `gh pr checks <n> --watch` until green; give CodeRabbit up to ~10 min to land if it reviews this PR, then triage its comments like step 2. Never merge on red.
5. **Merge** — squash, so `main` keeps one commit per PR; title `<type>: <imperative, lowercase>` under 70 chars:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch
   ```

Completion per PR: merged, or parked with a written blocker. A parked PR never silently blocks the queue — record the blocker and move on.

## Phase 3 — Report

One compact table: PR · action taken (merged / closed-duplicate / parked / flagged) · comments fixed vs declined · panel rounds and confirmed findings · blockers. Flagged promotion PRs get an explicit "awaiting your call" line.

**Leanness rule.** Subagents return structured summaries under ~200 words (files touched, decisions, verdicts, blockers). The conductor never reads full diffs or issue bodies into its own window — if a subagent starts dumping a diff, tell it to summarize.
